AlloyGBM Documentation
======================

**AlloyGBM** is a Rust-first gradient boosting library supporting regression,
binary and multi-class classification, and learning-to-rank, with a Python API
oriented around native execution, deterministic training, explicit validation,
time-aware workflows, and zero-copy artifact-backed prediction.

The project is strongest on panel-style and finance-style workloads, with
competitive performance on general tabular benchmarks across all three task
types.

.. note::

   AlloyGBM ``0.12.10`` is a patch optimization release:
   it avoids full PL histogram construction when solving selected linear
   child leaves, speeds numeric ``split_penalty`` neutralization with
   factor prefix sums, adds ``factor_exposure_transform`` preprocessing for
   fit-time exposures, and exports ``alloygbm.__version__``. No artifact
   format change. See :doc:`release` for full notes.
