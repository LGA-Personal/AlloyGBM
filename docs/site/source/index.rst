AlloyGBM Documentation
======================

**AlloyGBM** is a Rust-first gradient boosting library supporting regression,
binary and multi-class classification, and learning-to-rank, with a Python API
oriented around native execution, deterministic training, explicit validation,
time-aware workflows, and zero-copy artifact-backed prediction.

The project is strongest on panel-style and finance-style workloads, with
competitive performance on general tabular benchmarks across all three task
types.

.. note::

   AlloyGBM ``0.7.0`` introduces factor-neutral boosting via
   ``neutralization`` and fit-time ``factor_exposures``. It also includes the
   DRO scalar leaf solver, piecewise-linear leaves, MorphBoost adaptive split
   criterion, per-iteration learning-rate schedules, and SIMD-accelerated
   histogram and EMA kernels. See :doc:`estimator` and :doc:`morphboost` for
   parameter docs, and :doc:`release` for full notes.
